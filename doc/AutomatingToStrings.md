If you are anything like me, there is nothing worse than having to edit all sorts of bizarre methods on a class whenever you add a field to a class. For that reason I always find myself reluctant to maintaining the `ToString()` method. 

With  Stateprinter the situation changes as only a standard implementation is needed, and which does not require changing when fields are added or removed. For an extra productivity boost, I can even add it as part of my code-template in my editor (see  [vs code templates](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247121.aspx) and [ReSharper code templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_templates.html)).

Stateprinter can seamlesly integrate with projects already having a number of ToString-implementations. When printing an object, or field of an object, that implements the ToString method, that method is used in preference of the standard stateprinter printing.


## 1.1 Simple example usage

To understand just how easy it is to use consider this implementation of a class with two fields. The class has a `ToString` method simply invocing the stateprinter which then using run-time code generation generates code that recursively visits all objects of the graph and prints them.

```C#
class AClassWithToString
{
  string B = "hello";
  int[] C = {5,4,3,2,1};

  // Nice stuff ahead!
  static readonly Stateprinter printer = new Stateprinter();
  
  public override string ToString()
  {
    return printer.PrintObject(this);
  }
}
```

The static `printer` reference is not a requirement, but ensures optimal performance since aspects of the introspection of types is cached in each printer instance.


We can in an object as always by:

```C#
Console.WriteLine( new AClassWithToString() );
```

We print the object. Stateprinter support a number of pre-defined styles of output, and you can easily create your own style if you want (since the output styles have been created by *dog fooding* we know this to be true :-). 

The output styles are easily configured using the `printer.Configuration.SetOutputStyle()`

we get (**curlybrace-style**)

```C#
	new AClassWithToString()
	{
	    B = ""hello""
	    C = new Int32[]()
	    C[0] = 5
	    C[1] = 4
	    C[2] = 3
	    C[3] = 2
	    C[4] = 1
	}
```

or (**json-style**)

```JSON
{
    ""B"" : ""hello"",
    ""C"" :
    [
        ""C"" : 5,
        ""C"" : 4,
        ""C"" : 3,
        ""C"" : 2,
        ""C"" : 1
    ]
}
```

or (**xml-style**)
 
```XML
<ROOT type='AClassWithToString'>
    <B>hello</B>
    <C type='Int32[]'>
        <Enumeration>
        <C>5</C>
        <C>4</C>
        <C>3</C>
        <C>2</C>
        <C>1</C>
        </Enumeration>
    </C>
</ROOT>
``` 
 


## 1.2 Object graphs and cycles

To dump an object graph all you need to do is first to create an object graph

```C#
var car = new Car(new SteeringWheel(new FoamGrip("Plastic")));
car.Brand = "Toyota";
```

then print it

```C#
Stateprinter printer = new Stateprinter();
Console.WriteLine(printer.PrintObject(car));
```

and you get the following output
	
```C#
new Car()
{
    StereoAmplifiers = null
    steeringWheel = new SteeringWheel()
    {
        Size = 3
        Grip = new FoamGrip()
        {
            Material = ""Plastic""
        }
        Weight = 525
    }
    Brand = ""Toyota""
}
``` 

Naturally, circular references are supported

```C#
var course = new Course();
course.Members.Add(new Student("Stan", course));
course.Members.Add(new Student("Richy", course));

Console.WriteLine(printer.PrintObject(course));
```

yields	 

```	     
new Course(), ref: 0
{
    Members = new List<Student>()
    Members[0] = new Student()
    {
        name = ""Stan""
        course =  -> 0
    }
    Members[1] = new Student()
    {
        name = ""Richy""
        course =  -> 0
    }
}
```

notice the `-> 0` this is a pointer back to an already printed object. Notice that references are only added to the output if needed. This amongst alot of other details are configurable.


## 1.3 Configuration

The Stateprinter is *very* configurable and extendible. See [configuration](HowToConfigure.md) for the vast possibilities.


## 1.4 Code readability and maintainability

Let us first look at the readability issues of creating `ToString()` methods. Then in the next section look at performance numbers. 
 Given a class `AClass` we can implement the `ToString()` either manually or using the Stateprinter. And when using the stateprinter, we can choose to either reuse the same instance or create a new each time.

```C#
class AClass
{
    string B = "hello";
    int[] C = {5,4,3,2,1};
}
```

The two implementation approaches

```C#
public string UseNewStateprinter()
{
    return new Stateprinter().PrintObject(this);
}
```

and

```C#
readonly Stateprinter printer = new Stateprinter();
public string ReuseStateprinter()
{
    return printer.PrintObject(this);
}
```

Notice that for both implementations **we do not** reference the fields `B` or `C` explicitly. This means zero maintenance when the class changes its fields!
In stark contrast is a manual implementation where we have to deal with each field separately, and when a field may be null, or, it possibly holds more than a single value, it needs be iterated somehow.

```C#
public string NativeWithLoop()
{
    string result = "B = " + B;
    
    result += " C = ";
    if (C != null)
    {
        if (C.Length > 0)
        {
            int i = 0;
            for (; i < C.Length - 1; i++) 
                result += C[i] + ", ";
            result += C[i];
        }
    }
    else
        result += "null";
    return result;
}
```

We can make it a bit clearer using `string.Join()` and LINQ

```C#
public string NativeWithLinq()
{
    return string.Format("B = {0} C = {1}", 
        B, 
        C == null 
            ? "null" 
            : string.Join(", ", C.Select(x => x.ToString()).ToArray()));
}
```

From a readability perspective, Stateprinter beats the manual implementations!


## 1.5 Performance

Now, look at some of the performance characteristics of Stateprinter. 


Test scores for printing 100.000 instances of `AClass` to a string.
    
      v2.1.220          milliseconds
            newStateprinter:     8550
            cachedPrinter:       3110
            nativeWithLoop:        97
            nativeWithLinq:       161
      v2.2.x             milliseconds
            newStateprinter:     5275
            cachedPrinter:       1353
            nativeWithLoop:        95
            nativeWithLinq:       167

As can be seen we are roughly 10x slower than the manual implementation. Still, we manage to print 100000 objects in less than 1.5 seconds. Moreover the output is in many cases nicer than what you will bother do manually.

Now there is some overhead in dealing with collections. So we can tune the printing, to place the array values on one line (like in the hand coded example).
          
```C#
var genericConverter = new GenericValueConverter<int[]>(y => string.Join(", ", y.Select(x => x.ToString()).ToArray()));
tunedPrinter.Configuration.Add(genericConverter);
```

With this modification to the `printer` we can achieve a run time of

            tunedPrinter:         747

As can be seen, the throughput of Stateprinter is increasing as the product mature. Hopefully, we can continue this nice trend in future releases.

## 1.6 Best practices

When using StatePrinter as the ToString() implementation speed may be a consideration. StatePrinter is fairly quick, partly because the introspection of types is cached within the StatePrinter instance and due to the use of run-time code generation. Therefore, it is a bad idea from a performance perspective to instantiate a Stateprinter for every use situation. A better approach is to instantiate and hold a static reference in each class, or inject an instance using IoC into your instance.

For unit testing these are not irrelevant concerns.





Have fun!
